A frontend for Realraum; work in progress.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
  - Rust is a modern systems programming language focusing on safety, speed, and concurrency
  - It empowers everyone to build reliable and efficient software
  - Realraum UI is written in Rust, compiled to WebAssembly, and runs in the browser
- [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/#getting-started)
  - Trunk is a tool for building, bundling, and serving Rust WebAssembly apps
  - It's used to build the Realraum UI frontend
- Tailwind CSS ([AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tailwindcss-bin/), [bins](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases))
  - This project is set up to run `tailwindcss`, not `npx tailwindcss`, so you should install a binary version of Tailwind CSS
